    "description": "<p>Join us for our short workshop introducing JavaScript for total beginners! This is a two-hour preview class to give you a taste of web development and help you decide if you want to go further with JavaScript programming. :)</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>What You'll Learn</b></p> <p>JavaScript is one of the most in-demand skills in the tech industry. It can be thought of as an extension to HTML which allows developers to incorporate more functionality into their web pages (such as an expandable menu or animated slideshow). </p> <p>Many programming courses end up glossing over some of the tricky words -- 'variable', 'object', 'method' -- this course is especially designed for beginners new to programming concepts, so you'll learn to program with JavaScript. If those words are confusing to you now, no worries! You're exactly who we want to teach.</p> <p>In this class, we will be covering basic programming fundamentals and how to make web pages interactive by combining JavaScript with HTML. Students will exit this class with a good grasp of basic programming principles and the knowledge of how to manipulate HTML elements.</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Prerequisites</b> </p> <p>You should be comfortable with the basics of HTML and CSS -- we highly recommend taking one of our Intro to HTML/CSS classes first!</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Java versus JavaScript</b></p> <p>It's super confusing, but there are two separate programming languages called Java and JavaScript. Even more confusing? They really have nothing to do with one another. How do you figure out which one you want to learn? Here's a quick and simple overview:</p> <p><b>Java </b>is a back-end programming language most often used to create large, enterprise-level applications. It can be used to create websites, but can also be used to create stand-alone software.</p> <p><b>JavaScript </b>is a front-end programming language that's most often used to create interactivity in websites: drop-down menus, slide shows, tabs, accordions, ajax, games, etc.</p> <p>Sure, it's a lot more complicated than that, but at a high level that should help you figure out which one you're looking for. Any questions? Hit us up at losangeles [at] girldevelopit.com and we'll gladly help you get it all sorted out.</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>What to Bring </b></p> <p><br/>Please bring a laptop (or borrow one, see below!)* and charger to class. Power outlets and wifi will be provided. You may also wish to bring a notepad and pen/pencil for taking notes.</p> <p>We'll be using a modern web browser and a text editor in class. If you don't already have these installed, please install them before you come to class.</p> <p>For web browsers, we recommend <a href=\"http://firefox.com/\">Mozilla Firefox</a> or <a href=\"http://google.com/chrome\">Google Chrome</a>. For a text editor, we recommend <a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com/\">Sublime Text 3</a>. Note that you do not have to purchase Sublime Text 3. If you download the free evaluation version that will be good enough for class.</p> <p><b>* Request to borrow a laptop: </b>No laptop? We have a limited number of laptops we can loan to students during class. Please fill out our<b> <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-HHF9IB2VlYVRivz5Zn7LwkjQAYkJLZsuW0YM4hh60U/viewform\">Laptop Request form</a></b> to let us know you need to borrow one!</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Questions? </b></p> <p><br/>We're here to help!
