# allauth site?
In django admin, it says:
Add a Site for your domain, matching settings.SITE_ID (django.contrib.sites app). 
Can I use localhost? Made up name? How is this used?

# How to mix custom templates + default?
How can I use allauth's (or django's) templates with my own base template, styling?

# what should I use between github + facebook accounts to display profile, url capture group?

# login redirects to accounts/login or accounts/profile -- how should I define url? redefine url? does it mess things up if I define profile/ instead

# how do I configure facebook, github for testing from localhost?

# post request to profile -- request.POST.get('user') instea of get w/url?
if its a post request how do i wire up references to it?
or -- user is already know since logged in -- just access in template

# why does the signup page exist but not login???? where is magic happening?
