Caution - putting github/fb apps in db for allauth, and putting db in git, and app in github...

Fixtures?

Django testrunner w/selenium function tests?
Name my functional test functional_test? test_functional? folder?
leverage allauth tests?
https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth/blob/master/allauth/account/tests.py

So many ways to do it.....LiveServerTestCase/Static+django test runner (location to run from	?), unittest and no django test runner

Getting it working FB, GitHub login

Am I commenting the right way to be able to generate documentation later?

Outline next steps

-managment command for scheduling asking cron job




# allauth site?
In django admin, it says:
Add a Site for your domain, matching settings.SITE_ID (django.contrib.sites app). 
Can I use localhost? Made up name? How is this used?

URL Blocked: This redirect failed because the redirect URI is not whitelisted in the appâ€™s Client OAuth Settings. Make sure Client and Web OAuth Login are on and add all your app domains as Valid OAuth Redirect URIs.

# How to mix custom templates + default?
How can I use allauth's (or django's) templates with my own base template, styling?

# what should I use between github + facebook accounts to display profile, url capture group?

# login redirects to accounts/login or accounts/profile -- how should I define url? redefine url? does it mess things up if I define profile/ instead

# how do I configure facebook, github for testing from localhost?

# post request to profile -- request.POST.get('user') instea of get w/url?
if its a post request how do i wire up references to it?
or -- user is already know since logged in -- just access in template

# why does the signup page exist but not login???? where is magic happening?

# Many to many fields
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/db/models/#intermediary-manytomany
Your intermediate model must contain one - and only one - foreign key to the source model - does it matter which?

# is my many to many table ok? urg circular imports

nested json
better ways to figure stuff out


customize default templates

python manage.py test
python manage.py test functional_tests
